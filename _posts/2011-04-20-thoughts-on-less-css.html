<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started using <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> (an extension of CSS that adds variables, mixins, operations, and functions) and I think I&rsquo;m in love. I was initially hesitant, but diving in and giving it a go was such a pleasant experience&mdash;I won&rsquo;t be going back to pure CSS anytime soon. Biggest selling point? Nested rules, by far.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>LESS gives you variables (technically constants, since they can&rsquo;t be redefined) that are prefixed by an ampersand. Very useful for color definitions.</p>
<pre><code>
@color: #4D926F;

#header {
   color: @color;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Mixins</h3>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
