<p>For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve used iTunes as my primary music player (Amarok was before that, back before version 2 was released). I&rsquo;ve never been happy with how iTunes works, and I can&rsquo;t seem to find another music player that has all the features I am looking for.</p>

<p>Large libraries are becoming more and more of a standard (mine has grown to 200 GB recently). I&rsquo;m continually shocked at iTunes&rsquo; lack of responsiveness in handing libraries of this size&mdash;and am looking for a better solution.

<h2>Key Beliefs</h2>

<h3>A library shouldn&rsquo;t freak out when I remove a volume.</h3>

<p>I keep a lot of music on my external drives. One of the things I hate about using iTunes is that little exclamation point that appears when a file is missing but is in your library. You&rsquo;re more than familiar with this icon if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to play an item out of your library which is no longer located where iTunes thinks it is.</p>

<p><strong>I believe</strong> that a music player application should be able to keep track of the &ldquo;root&rdquo; level folder that each folder is located in, and detect if that folder is removed (and subsequently, replaced).</p>

<p>This is what I call a &ldquo;source.&rdquo; A source is merely a storage location that contains music files and is indexed. Providing that this &ldquo;source&rdquo; idea is abstracted from the player, many kinds of sources could exist (such as local network sources, WebDAV sources, Dropbox sources, Grooveshark, etc).</p>


<h3>A library should share nicely, both by streaming and remotely accessing the files directly if available.</h3>

<p>A nice feature of iTunes is its ability to share your library with other users on your local network easily. This essentially allows another user access to the music available in that library.</p>
   
<p><strong>I believe</strong> that a music player should allow you to share your sources with other local users&mdash;and if the source is publicly accessible, give other local users the option of duplicating the source&rsquo;s metadata (so it can be accessed by the local machine independently).</p>


<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Easily handle large libraries&mdash;quick startup and maintain responsiveness.</li>
   <li>Play to remote devices (AirPlay).</li>
   <li>Web broadcasts (Podcasting).</li>
   <li>Stop with fadeout.</li>
   <li>Support playlisting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>SQL databases</strong> have been around forever, yet not many music player applications use them as backends. Amarok, back when I used it, used SQL (Postgre)&mdash;and it was fantastic. I could search my library of 60,000 songs (at that time) in less than a tenth of a second.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I&rsquo;m a Mac person&mdash;who uses Windows and Linux on a regular basis. It&rsquo;d sure be swell if it was cross platform. Anybody know of a player? :)</p>
