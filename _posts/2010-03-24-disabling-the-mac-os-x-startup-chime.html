<p>A big complaint about Mac laptops is that pretentious &ldquo;startup chime&rdquo; that quickly identifies to everyone within hearing distance that someone nearby has started their Mac. I&rsquo;ve seen a few solutions that require <code>defaults write</code> but they have never seemed to work for me. I&rsquo;ve finally found a working solution, and it&rsquo;s elegant(ish).

<p>The solution comes from <a href="http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~arcana/index.en.html">Arcana Research</a>. They&rsquo;ve created a Preferences Pane for your Mac&rsquo;s System Preferences that allows you to adjust the volume of your startup chime (or mute it!). It&rsquo;s <a href="http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~arcana/software.en.html">available as freeware</a> and compatible with OS X 10.4 and later.</p> 
 
<p>It might take a reboot before the software takes affect. In actuality what the software does is save your current volume setting on shutdown, adjust your volume to your &ldquo;startup volume&rdquo; setting, and after the computer boots, changes your volume back to where it was.</p>
