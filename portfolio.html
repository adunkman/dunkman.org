               <h3>Boy Scout Troop 512&rsquo;s Spaghetti Dinner</h3>
               <p>Yes, I was once a Boy Scout&mdash;a member of Troop 512 based out of Woodridge, Illinois. I was contacted to whip up a set of tickets and churned these out in a few hours. Surprisingly, I&rsquo;m still happy with the way they turned out.</p>
               <p>The chef graphic has been the logo of the Spaghetti Dinner for the last five years or so, and it was the only design requirement.</p>
               <p>Graphic design community: sorry, but I just had to use Sign Painter.</p>

               <h3>Missouri S&amp;T Safe Space Program</h3>
               <p>A &ldquo;Safe Space&rdquo; is a place in which anti-LGBT violence and harassment is not tolerated and is an environment that is open and accepting of everyone. The Safe Space Program was started at Missouri S&amp;T to train students, staff, and faculty in LGBT issues and educate them in what is offensive and what is not.</p>
               
               <p>The manual was given to me in draft to revise for content, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but put a fresh coat of paint on it (or, more realistically, destroy the manual&rsquo;s formatting and rebuild it).</p>
                  
               <p><strong>Details:</strong> PDF, Printed double-sided on plain white paper, color, 8.5x11" portrait. Tools used: Adobe InDesign, Illustrator.</p>

               <h3>Missouri S&amp;T DaVinci Society</h3>
               <p>The DaVinci Society is a student organization for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning students, staff, and faculty, along with supportive allies (mouthful, amirite?).</p>
               
               <p>When I entered the organization, their website was years out-of-date, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure they still existed. After a year of attending meetings, I took over their website in order to bring a fresher look and more up-to-date content. I started by analyzing what the website was currently being used for, and drew up a new design that was a lot more colorful (it is the &ldquo;gay club,&rdquo; after all) and organized.</p>
               
               <p>Although I no longer maintain the website, the organization continues to use and update the design with little or no modification.</p>
