      h1 <strong>Hey there!</strong> I’m Andrew Dunkman.
      p I focus on people and design human user interfaces. <a href="/about" class="read-on">More</a>
      p <strong>I’m passionate about usable software.</strong> I believe that user manuals should never have to be printed. If your software can’t be figured out by looking at it, there’s no hope for the sad humans that have to use it on an infrequent basis (and unless your software is particularly useful or money-making, that’s all of your users).
      p <strong>I currently work for <a href="http://softekinc.com">Softek Solutions, Inc.</a> in Prairie Village, Kansas.</strong> I appreciate working in small business, as the family-like company atmosphere harbors brilliant talent and knocks down pillars of knowledge. There’s nothing like nurturing your ideas from infancy to production to give you job satisfaction.
      p <strong>In my personal life,</strong> I try to sit in silence for at least 20 minutes a day and let my thoughts wander. While I walk, I smile. I try not to waste my energy comparing my life to others and hate hate (with a passion). When something isn’t useful, beautiful, or joyful, it’s time to move on.
