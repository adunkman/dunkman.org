            <p><strong>I&rsquo;m passionate about usable software.</strong> I believe that user manuals should never have to be printed. If your software can&rsquo;t be figured out by looking at it, there&rsquo;s no hope for the sad humans that have to use it on an infrequent basis (and unless your software is particularly useful or money-making, that&rsquo;s all of your users).</p>
            <p><strong>I currently work for Softek Solutions, Inc. in Prairie Village, Kansas.</strong> I appreciate working in small business, as the family-like company atmosphere harbors brilliant talent and knocks down pillars of knowledge. There&rsquo;s nothing like nurturing your ideas from infancy to production to give you job satisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>In my personal life,</strong> I try to sit in silence for at least 20 minutes a day and let my thoughts wander. While I walk, I smile. I try not to waste my energy comparing my life to others and hate hate (with a passion). When something isn&rsquo;t useful, beautiful, or joyful, it&rsquo;s time to move on.</p>
